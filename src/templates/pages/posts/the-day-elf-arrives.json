		"So finally it's time to introduce that little elf that has been strategically hidden in the back of a draw or the corner of a wardrobe. But when and how?",
		"When, is entirely up to ? It is suggested they arrive on the 1st December but they could come earlier or later depending what fits in with your family.",
		"How is another story all together!",
		"Everyone will have their own ideas on how to introduce their elf and sometimes it depends on if its a first or return visit.",
		"On our first visit our elf simply was positioned at the letterbox all wrapped up in its parcel with its letter, snow and candy cane.",
		"Last year was a return visit for 'Ginger' so she literally appeared in the living room with a chocolate advent calendar and a Lego friends one that my daughter wanted and a letter saying I'm back! She was so excited to see the elf again she wasn't interested in the advents for a few hours. For me this is why I don't do too much on the first day. The kids are normally so excited anyway you may as well save the other things for later in the period."
