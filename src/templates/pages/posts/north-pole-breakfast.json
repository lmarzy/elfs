		"Your elf doesn't have to be mischievous or funny every day and a great idea for something nice that the whole family can take part in is the North Pole Breakfast.",
		"The children awake on the morning to find the table laid by your elf all ready for an elf style breakfast.",
		"You can go as full on or not as you wish for this. Food generally tends to be a little unhealthy (the staple of an elf's diet is candy....it's true Buddy the elf says so!) But you can go to town with your own ideas.",
		"Drinks for us would normally be hot chocolate...obviously or milk. You could put a candy cane in the milk which will not only add effect but as the candy cane starts to dissolve it will turn the milk pink! Water or juice is good too.",

		"Food...well we could be here all day !"

	"detailsList":  [
		"Mini snow (icing sugar) covered donuts.",
		"Croissants",
		"Pain au chocolate",
		"Mini scotch/American pancakes - I have a really easy recipe for this if you want it !",
		"Blueberry or chocolate mini muffins",
		"Little tubs of Yoghurt",
		"Froot loops cereal (multi coloured loops !!! probably has 1000 E numbers but its multi grain!!)",
		"Little pieces of strawberry and little pieces of banana alternated and arranged on a plate in the shape of a candy cane (my healthy suggestion)",
		"2 white marshmallows threaded on a cocktail stick to look like snowmen (decorate with coloured icing)",
		"Mini Gingerbread men cookies - last year I got a box of cookies from Tesco which contained little tubes of writing icing so she could decorate her cookies and that we didnâ€™t eat were made into hanging tree decorations."

	"detailsExtra": [
		"Or you could just have your normal breakfast !!!",
		"Your elf could also bring a little craft activity for your little one to do that day or maybe a note letting them know how well they are doing with their behaviour and if they are looking like they will get on the nice list.",
		"Lots of people use this for the arrival of their elf but I like to keep it for another day. We tend to do it on a weekend when we have nothing else planned so all the family can have a nice relaxing breakfast together. "
