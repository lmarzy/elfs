		"The beauty of Christmas Elf is that it really can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. There are no hard and fast rules of when the elf arrives or leaves and what the elf gets up to whilst he is with you really is all down to you.",
		"Some people go to great lengths (and really do enjoy ) thinking of all the things the elf can get up to during the night. Check out our Instagram page to see some of the photos. Other people simply move the elf from one place to another each night.",
		"My own elf didn't always get up to 'mischief' !! Some nights I forgot !! Some nights I couldn't be bothered and some nights I left my husband in charge!! hmmm.........",
		"On these nights 'Ginger' simply moved places or brought a small gift for my daughter, such as Christmas sweets or crafts to make.",
		"My tip would always try to plan for those evenings and maybe get a few bits in to use for such events. If you get stuck for ideas just search the internet, there are simply tons of blogs, pintrest pages and posts from others to help get your creative juices flowing.",
		"Here's a few to get you going"
