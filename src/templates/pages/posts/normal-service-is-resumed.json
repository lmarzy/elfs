		"So I am now into the last few days of the summer holidays and what hard work it has been!",

		"I love being at home with Tilly and I love the school holidays - they mean no alarm and I get to spend loads of time with her doing fun things as she is growing up way to fast.",

		"But working from home is tough during the holidays! Not helped by the fact that my business is a complete secret from my daughter. You see she was the reason Christmas Elf started so she has her own little elf called Ginger who comes to visit each year. Now I don't want to spoil the magic as I want her to 'believe' for as long as possible (you're an adult for way to long!)",

		"So during the holidays most of the admin, packing, ordering, creating all has to take place on an evening when she has either gone to bed (not easy as its always late during the holidays) or when my hubby can distract her long enough to not wonder where I am !",

		"I have been packing in the garage as I can't bring my stock into the dining room as I normally would.",

		"So whilst I really feel bad for wishing the holidays away as soon she won't want to spend them with me anymore anyway, I must say that I am somewhat relieved that I can do my work during the day, get to bed at a reasonable hour and spend more time promoting and growing my business in the evenings on my social media platforms.",

		"So normal service will be resumed....well for 6 weeks then its half term !!!!!!!!!!"
