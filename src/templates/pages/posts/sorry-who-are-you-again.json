		"Well it's all go here at Christmas Elf, first a brand spanking new website, then twitter and now I'm blogging !!!!",
		"So I thought maybe my first blog should be a little bit about me, my life and how Christmas Elf was created.",
		"My name is Emma and I am a wife to Lee and a mummy to Tilly who is 8. We live in the middle of Sherwood Forest, well...not in a tree or anything but in the village of Edwinstowe where the famous Major Oak is located.",
		"I gave up my full time work as an admin manager a few years ago now when I was made redundant. My hubbie set up his own business so I started to help out with this instead. I basically do all the admin and all the rubbish jobs that he doesn't want to do! luckily he doesn't work from home or we may have killed each other by now!",
		"This is my third year of running Christmas Elf. It started when I found the American tradition and wanted to do it for my own little girl but trying to find an elf, even at Christmas time was like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. I found the original American elf's but to be honest they kind of creeped me out so after a light bulb moment I spotted a gap in the market and decided to do something about it.",
		"I secured my stock and set up a Facebook page to promote it, not knowing if it would flop or be a great  hit - I sold out! I got more stock and I sold out! Each year has got busier and busier for me. I'm not sure how I actually get through November its literally a blur but the feedback I get from customers and all the photos I get of the children and their elves makes it all worthwhile.",
		"Since I started lots more people have caught on to the tradition and there are many elf sellers around now but as long as I have customers I will continue with my little elf's"
